> Find a web company near you ! ðŸ’»

Quite a simple website : we have a list of web companies and we allow visitors to filter that list based on their desired location, tech or work.


## Where to find it

This app is deployed on [a subdomain of my personnal website](http://internship.tanguyscholtes.be/).


## Technologies

Front-end is in [React](https://reactjs.org/), bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
Back-end was supposed to be a headless [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) CMS using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), but I did not have the time to dig Strapi yet. So there's no back-end at the moment. Yeah, I know it's bad... ðŸ˜”


## Companies

It currently displays web companies mostly from LiÃ¨ge, but feel free to [contact me](mailto:tanguy.scholtes@gmail.com) to expand that list !

No commercial use is made of this site (please don't sue me).  
My one and only goal is to list web companies (the like you could find in Les Pages d'Or, for example), as exhaustively as possible, for web students, learners and juniors to easily find where to apply for internships and jobs.  
If your company is in the list and you want to see it removed or any of the informations changed, [contact me](mailto:tanguy.scholtes@gmail.com) and I'll do it as soon as possible.
